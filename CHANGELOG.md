## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `cds up` now supports `--no-build` to skip Docker Compose image builds when images are already available.

### Changed

- `cds up` now runs `docker compose build` before `docker compose up` by default.
- CI now measures test coverage on the Ubuntu leg of the test matrix and fails the build if `cli/` coverage drops below 65%.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- Default render output path to project-root docker-compose.yml when no output is provided.
- Open-source project governance and support docs.
- Troubleshooting guidance in the README for common CLI validation, secret, and contract-binding errors.
- Added `docs/os-compatibility.md` with OS compatibility analysis and recommendations.
- Improved the bug report template with severity and minimal repro fields.

### Changed

- Compose rendering now preserves secrets as runtime environment placeholders instead of embedding resolved values.
- Plan secret mapping now stores env variable names rather than secret values.
- Renderer build-context path rewriting now preserves portable relative paths for nested compose output directories.

### Tests

- Added renderer regression coverage to ensure generated Docker Compose output never includes raw secret values.

### Security

- Added explicit security reporting process and secret-handling guidance.
