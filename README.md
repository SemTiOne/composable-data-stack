## 🧠 What Is CDS (In 1 Minute)

Composable Data Stack (CDS) is a framework for defining and assembling data platforms from reusable modules such as orchestrators, warehouses, BI tools, and secrets providers.

Instead of hardcoding integrations or relying on fragile pipelines, CDS introduces:

- 🔧 **Modules**: reusable components (Dagster, Postgres, Superset)
- 🔗 **Contracts**: explicit interfaces between components
- 🧩 **Profiles**: fully composed, runnable stacks

Think of it as Infrastructure as Code, but for data platforms.

---

## ⚡ Why CDS

Modern data platforms force a trade-off:

|Approach|Problem|
|---|---|
|Monolithic stack|Rigid, hard to evolve|
|Custom pipelines|Flexible but fragile and inconsistent|

CDS gives you the best of both:

- composability without chaos
- flexibility with guarantees
- modularity with structure
- no vendor lock-in by design

---

## 🎯 When To Use CDS

Use CDS if you:

- want to swap tools (Airflow ↔ Dagster, Superset ↔ Metabase)
- need reproducible environments across dev, CI, and prod
- are building a platform for multiple teams
- want contract-driven integration instead of implicit coupling

CDS may be overkill if:

- you only run a single-tool stack
- you do not need interchangeable components

---

## 🏗️ Example

The `local-dagster-postgres-superset` profile defines:

- Dagster -> orchestration
- Postgres -> storage
- Superset -> BI

### What CDS Does

1. Validates module definitions
2. Resolves contract bindings
3. Checks compatibility and security constraints
4. Produces a fully wired stack definition

`cds plan` resolves the full dependency graph before runtime configuration is generated, ensuring all module interactions are valid and predictable.

You can replace components without changing system behavior:

```text
Dagster -> Airflow
Superset -> Metabase
Postgres -> MariaDB
```

## 🗺️ Architecture Overview

CDS wires modules through **contracts**, not direct dependencies:

    classDef viz stroke:#a78bfa,fill:#f5f3ff

    class Dagster tool
    class Postgres database
    class Superset viz
```

## 🔐 Security

CDS includes built-in security validation to prevent unsafe configurations before a stack is deployed.

The `cds security` checks analyze profiles and modules for common risks such as:

- weak or default passwords
- missing secret configurations
- insecure service exposure
- unsafe defaults in module configuration
- incomplete contract bindings that may leak data

Security checks run as part of validation and can be extended with custom rules.

### Example

```bash
cds security local-dagster-postgres-superset
```

---

## 📦 What You Get

When you run CDS:

- validated module graph
- resolved contract bindings
- dependency-aware execution plan
- generated Docker Compose configuration
- reproducible stack definition

This allows you to go from a declarative profile to a runnable local data stack.

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RonaldHensbergen/composable-data-stack.git
cd composable-data-stack
```

### 2. Setup Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

### 3. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set:

```text
CDS_POSTGRES_PASSWORD
CDS_SUPERSET_SECRET_KEY
CDS_SUPERSET_ADMIN_PASSWORD
```

### 4. Validate A Stack

```bash
cds validate local-dagster-postgres-superset
```

Expected output:

```text
Profile is valid.
```

### 5. Run Security Checks

```bash
cds security local-dagster-postgres-superset
```

### 6. Generate A Plan

```bash
cds plan local-dagster-postgres-superset
```

This resolves:

- module dependencies
- contract bindings
- execution order

### 7. Render The Stack

```bash
cds render local-dagster-postgres-superset
```

By default, this writes `docker-compose.yml` to the project root so you can run `docker compose up` immediately.

Use a custom location when needed:

```bash
cds render local-dagster-postgres-superset --output build/docker-compose.yml
```

This generates:

- docker-compose.yml
- service definitions
- fully wired module configuration

## 🧩 Core Concepts

### Modules

Reusable building blocks:

- orchestration (Dagster, Airflow)
- warehouse (Postgres, MariaDB)
- BI (Superset, Metabase)
- secrets (env, vault)

Structure:

```text
modules/<category>/<name>/
├── module.yaml
├── defaults.yaml
├── compose.yaml
├── scripts/
└── tests/
```

### Contracts

Contracts define how modules interact.

Examples:

|Contract|Purpose|
|---|---|
|sql-database|database interface|
|http-service|service exposure|
|secrets-provider|secret resolution|

Example binding:

```text
dagster.database -> postgres.sql-database
superset.database -> postgres.sql-database
```

No implicit dependencies. Everything is explicit.

### Profiles

Profiles define supported stacks:

```text
local-dagster-postgres-superset
local-airflow-postgres-superset
integration-airflow-postgres-dbt
```

Structure:

```text
profiles/[profile]/
├── profile.yaml
├── values.yaml
└── README.md
```

## ⚙️ CLI

|Command|Description|
|---|---|
|cds validate [profile]|Validate modules and contracts|
|cds plan [profile]|Resolve dependencies and generate an execution plan|
|cds render [profile]|Generate Docker Compose configuration from a resolved plan|
|cds up [profile]|Start services (planned)|
|cds test [profile]|Run health checks (planned)|

---

## 🔄 Workflow

```text
1. cds validate -> check module definitions
2. cds security -> detect unsafe configurations
3. cds plan -> resolve dependencies and bindings
4. cds render -> generate Docker Compose stack
5. cds up -> start services (planned)
6. cds test -> run health checks (planned)
```

## 🧱 Design Principles

### Contract-First

Modules declare:

- what they provide
- what they require
- configuration inputs
- health checks
- lifecycle hooks

### Profile-Driven

Profiles define supported stacks.
The profile is the unit of support, not individual modules.

### Zero Hidden Coupling

- no implicit environment variables
- no cross-module assumptions
- no shared mutable state

All interactions happen through explicit contracts.

### Security By Default

CDS validates configurations before runtime, ensuring that:

- weak credentials are detected early
- secrets are properly configured
- services are not unintentionally exposed

Security is part of platform composition, not an afterthought.

### One Model, Multiple Environments

The same composition model applies across:

- local development
- CI environments
- production

Only runtime packaging differs.
