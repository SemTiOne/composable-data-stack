## 🧠 What Is CDS (In 1 Minute)

Composable Data Stack (CDS) is a framework for defining and assembling data platforms from reusable modules such as orchestrators, warehouses, BI tools, and secrets providers.

## 🤝 Get Involved

- **Star and follow** on GitHub: [RonaldHensbergen/composable-data-stack](https://github.com/RonaldHensbergen/composable-data-stack)
- **Contribute**: open a discussion, file an issue, or send a PR to help shape CDS
- **Proof it**: if you run it in a real workflow, share your feedback — good or bad

> **Note:** Development helper tools are located in the `tools/` directory (git-ignored). See `tools/pr-cli/README.md` for PR creation scripts.

Instead of hardcoding integrations or relying on fragile pipelines, CDS introduces:

- 🔧 **Modules**: reusable components (Dagster, Postgres, Superset)
- 🔗 **Contracts**: explicit interfaces between components
- 🧩 **Profiles**: fully composed, runnable stacks

Think of it as Infrastructure as Code, but for data platforms.

## ⚡ Why CDS

Modern data platforms force a trade-off:

|Approach|Problem|
|---|---|
|Monolithic stack|Rigid, hard to evolve|
|Custom pipelines|Flexible but fragile and inconsistent|

CDS gives you the best of both:

- composability without chaos
- flexibility with guarantees
- modularity with structure
- no vendor lock-in by design

---

## 🎯 When To Use CDS

Use CDS if you:

- want to swap tools (Airflow ↔ Dagster, Superset ↔ Metabase)
- need reproducible environments across dev, CI, and prod
- are building a platform for multiple teams
- want contract-driven integration instead of implicit coupling

CDS may be overkill if:

- you only run a single-tool stack
- you do not need interchangeable components

---

## 🏗️ Example

The `local-dagster-postgres-superset` profile defines:

- Dagster -> orchestration
- Postgres -> storage
- Superset -> BI

### What CDS Does

1. Validates module definitions
2. Resolves contract bindings
3. Checks compatibility and security constraints
4. Produces a fully wired stack definition

`cds plan` resolves the full dependency graph before runtime configuration is generated, ensuring all module interactions are valid and predictable.

You can replace components without changing system behavior:

```text
Dagster -> Airflow
Superset -> Metabase
Postgres -> MariaDB
```

## 🗺️ Architecture Overview

CDS wires modules through **contracts**, not direct dependencies:

    classDef viz stroke:#a78bfa,fill:#f5f3ff

    class Dagster tool
    class Postgres database
    class Superset viz
```

## 🔐 Security

CDS includes built-in security validation to prevent unsafe configurations before a stack is deployed.

The `cds security` checks analyze profiles and modules for common risks such as:

- weak or default passwords
- missing secret configurations
- insecure service exposure
- unsafe defaults in module configuration
- incomplete contract bindings that may leak data

Security checks run as part of validation and can be extended with custom rules.

### Example

```bash
cds security local-dagster-postgres-superset
```

---

## 📦 What You Get

When you run CDS:

- validated module graph
- resolved contract bindings
- dependency-aware execution plan
- generated Docker Compose configuration
- reproducible stack definition

This allows you to go from a declarative profile to a runnable local data stack.

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RonaldHensbergen/composable-data-stack.git
cd composable-data-stack
```

### 2. Setup Environment

Linux/macOS:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -e .
```

Windows CMD:

```bat
py -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
python -m pip install -e .
```

If PowerShell blocks the activation script, run
`Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass` in the same
terminal session and activate the environment again.

### 3. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set:

```text
CDS_POSTGRES_PASSWORD
CDS_SUPERSET_SECRET_KEY
CDS_SUPERSET_ADMIN_PASSWORD
```

### 4. Validate A Stack

```bash
cds validate local-dagster-postgres-superset
```

Expected output:

```text
Profile is valid.
```

### 5. Run Security Checks

```bash
cds security local-dagster-postgres-superset
```

### 6. Generate A Plan

```bash
cds plan local-dagster-postgres-superset
```

This resolves:

- module dependencies
- contract bindings
- execution order

### 7. Render The Stack

```bash
cds render local-dagster-postgres-superset
```

By default, this writes `docker-compose.yml` to the project root so you can run `docker compose up` immediately.

Use a custom location when needed:

```bash
cds render local-dagster-postgres-superset --output build/docker-compose.yml
```

This generates:

- docker-compose.yml
- service definitions
- fully wired module configuration

## 🧩 Core Concepts

### Modules

Reusable building blocks:

- orchestration (Dagster, Airflow)
- warehouse (Postgres, MariaDB)
- BI (Superset, Metabase)
- secrets (env, vault)

Structure:

```text
modules/<category>/<name>/
├── module.yaml
├── defaults.yaml
├── compose.yaml
├── scripts/
└── tests/
```

### Contracts

Contracts define how modules interact.

Examples:

|Contract|Purpose|
|---|---|
|sql-database|database interface|
|http-service|service exposure|
|secrets-provider|secret resolution|

Example binding:

```text
dagster.database -> postgres.sql-database
superset.database -> postgres.sql-database
```

No implicit dependencies. Everything is explicit.

### Profiles

Profiles define supported stacks:

```text
local-dagster-postgres-superset
local-airflow-postgres-superset
integration-airflow-postgres-dbt
```

Structure:

```text
profiles/[profile]/
├── profile.yaml
├── values.yaml
└── README.md
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

Common errors from `cds validate`, `cds plan`, and `cds render`, and how to fix them.

| Error | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[E020] ... YAML file not found: <path>` | The profile identifier or file path passed to `cds validate`, `cds plan`, or `cds render <profile>` doesn't resolve to an existing YAML file. | Run `cds list profiles` to see valid identifiers, or check that `CDS_PROFILE_PATH` points to the right profile file or directory. |
| `[E081] ... Required secret "CDS_X_PASSWORD" not found in environment` | A secret marked `required: true` in the profile's `spec.secrets.values` is missing from the shell environment or the `.env` file in the current working directory. | Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the project root and set the missing `CDS_*` variable, or export it directly before running the command. |
| `[E041] ... Contract ref "x.y" points to unknown module "x"` | A `consumes` binding's `contractRef` refers to a module ID that isn't defined in the profile. | Check `spec.modules` for the correct module `id`, and confirm the contract ref follows `<module-id>.<contract-name>`. |
| `[E041] ... but it does not provide "<contract-name>"` | The referenced module exists, but its `spec.provides` list doesn't expose that contract name. | Check the producing module's `module.yaml` for the contracts it actually provides, and fix the consumer's `contractRef` to match. |
| `[E042] ... Contract kind mismatch` | The consumer expects one contract kind (e.g. `sql-database`) but the producer exposes a different kind. | Point the binding at a module that provides the expected contract kind, or update the consumer's expected kind if the mismatch is intentional. |

All diagnostics print with their error code and YAML path (e.g. `spec.modules[1].config`), so search the profile file for that path to find the exact line to fix.

## 🧱 Design Principles

### Contract-First

Modules declare:

- what they provide
- what they require
- configuration inputs
- health checks
- lifecycle hooks

### Profile-Driven

Profiles define supported stacks.
The profile is the unit of support, not individual modules.

### Zero Hidden Coupling

- no implicit environment variables
- no cross-module assumptions
- no shared mutable state

All interactions happen through explicit contracts.

### Security By Default

CDS validates configurations before runtime, ensuring that:

- weak credentials are detected early
- secrets are properly configured
- services are not unintentionally exposed

Security is part of platform composition, not an afterthought.

### One Model, Multiple Environments

The same composition model applies across:

- local development
- CI environments
- production

Only runtime packaging differs.
