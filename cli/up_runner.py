    `timeout` seconds elapse.

    Returns `(settled, grouped)`. `settled` is False if the loop timed
    out, or if any service ended in UNHEALTHY / UNHEALTHY EXIT.

    `ps_fn`, `sleep_fn`, `now_fn`, and `redraw_fn` are injectable so this
    can be unit tested with a fake clock and canned `ps` output instead
    of real Docker calls and real sleeping.

    `up_done_fn`, if given, is polled once per iteration and must return
    `None` while `docker compose up` is still running, or its exit code
    once it has finished. This lets the caller run `up` in the
    background while this loop redraws the live view immediately,
    without either process blocking the other:

    - If `up` exits non-zero, this returns `(False, grouped)` right
      away instead of burning through the full `timeout`, since
      services that `up` never started will never settle.
    - The `timeout` clock only starts once `up` finishes successfully,
      so a stack whose healthchecks legitimately outlast `timeout`
      isn't penalized for time `up` itself spent blocked on
      healthcheck-gated `depends_on` dependencies. Omitting `up_done_fn`
      preserves the old behavior of starting the clock immediately.

    `on_up_finished`, if given, is called exactly once, the first time
    `up_done_fn` reports a successful result (exit code 0), so callers can
    defer setup (e.g. starting a log tail) until `up` is done rather
